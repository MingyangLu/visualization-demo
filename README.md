# test

> A Vue.js project
> This project, based on Echarts and Vue, is designed for data visualization UI. Only front-end code is involved. The geojson is painted with "geojson.io", since Yiwu is a county-level city and there is no detailed map json of Yiwu.
## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
